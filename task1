Project Overview: Basic Calculator

This project is a simple Python-based console application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and then choose an operation from a list of available choices. Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation and outputs the result.

 Key Features:
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: 
   - The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Each operation is implemented as a separate function (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
  
2. Error Handling:
   - The program handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values, using a try-except block to ensure the user enters valid numbers.
   - Division by zero is explicitly checked and an error message ("Error! Division by zero.") is displayed if the user attempts it.

3. User Interaction:
   - The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operation from a list of options (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).
   - Based on the user's choice, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed, and the result is displayed.

4. Input Validation:
   - The program checks for valid numeric inputs and ensures the user selects a valid operation (1, 2, 3, or 4). If the input is invalid, the program displays an appropriate message.

 Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Error Handling:try-except block to handle invalid input and division by zero.
  
CODE:
# Basic Calculator

    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
